    \ \nWith this functionality in place, administrators can create access profiles\
    \ and configure them for use throughout IdentityNow, enabling users to get the\
    \ access they need quickly and securely.\n\nAccess profiles group entitlements,\
    \ which represent access rights on sources. \n\nFor example, an Active Directory\
    \ source in IdentityNow can have multiple entitlements: the first, 'Employees,'\
    \ may represent the access all employees have at the organization, and a second,\
    \ 'Developers,' may represent the access all developers have at the organization.\n\
    \nAn administrator can then create a broader set of access in the form of an access\
    \ profile, 'AD Developers' grouping the 'Employees' entitlement with the 'Developers'\
    \ entitlement.\n\nWhen users only need Active Directory employee access, they\
    \ can request access to the 'Employees' entitlement.\n\nWhen users need both Active\
    \ Directory employee and developer access, they can request access to the 'AD\
    \ Developers' access profile.\n\nAccess profiles are the most important units\
    \ of access in IdentityNow. IdentityNow uses access profiles in many features,\
    \ including the following:\n\n- Provisioning: When you use the Provisioning Service,\
    \ lifecycle states and roles both grant access to users in the form of access\
    \ profiles.\n\n- Certifications: You can approve or revoke access profiles in\
    \ certification campaigns, just like entitlements. \n\n- Access Requests: You\
    \ can assign access profiles to applications, and when a user requests access\
    \ to the app associated with an access profile and someone approves the request,\
    \ access is granted to both the application and its associated access profile.\n\
    \n- Roles: You can group one or more access profiles into a role to quickly assign\
    \ access items based on an identity's role. \n\nIn IdentityNow, administrators\
    \ can use the Access drop-down menu and select Access Profiles to view, configure,\
    \ and delete existing access profiles, as well as create new ones. \nAdministrators\
    \ can enable and disable an access profile, and they can also make the following\
    \ configurations: \n\n- Manage Entitlements: Manage the profile's access by adding\
    \ and removing entitlements. \n\n- Access Requests: Configure access profiles\
    \ to be requestable and establish an approval process for any requests that the\
    \ access profile be granted or revoked. \nDo not configure an access profile to\
    \ be requestable without first establishing a secure access request approval process\
    \ for the access profile.\n\n- Multiple Account Options: Define the logic IdentityNow\
    \ uses to provision access to an identity with multiple accounts on the source.\

    \ tasks.  \n\nIn IdentityNow, users can request access to applications, entitlements,\
    \ and roles, and managers can request that team members' access be revoked.  \
    \ \nFor applications and entitlements, administrators can set access profiles\
    \ to require approval from the access profile owner, the application owner, the\
    \ source owner, the requesting user's manager, or a governance group for access\
    \ to be granted or revoked.   \nFor roles, administrators can also set roles to\
    \ allow access requests and require approval from the role owner, the requesting\

- description: "Use this API to implement and customize lifecycle state functionality.\n\
    With this functionality in place, administrators can create and configure custom\
    \ lifecycle states for use across their organizations, which is key to controlling\
    \ which users have access, when they have access, and the access they have.\n\n\
    A lifecycle state describes a user's status in a company. For example, two lifecycle\
    \ states come by default with IdentityNow: 'Active' and 'Inactive.' \nWhen an\
    \ active employee takes an extended leave of absence from a company, his or her\
    \ lifecycle state may change to 'Inactive,' for security purposes. \nThe inactive\
    \ employee would lose access to all the applications, sources, and sensitive data\
    \ during the leave of absence, but when the employee returns and becomes active\
    \ again, all that access would be restored. \nThis saves administrators the time\
    \ that would otherwise be spent provisioning the employee's access to each individual\
    \ tool, reviewing the employee's certification history, etc. \n\nAdministrators\
    \ can create a variety of custom lifecycle states. Refer to [Planning New Lifecycle\
    \ States](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/provisioning/lifecycle.html#planning-new-lifecycle-states)\
    \ for some custom lifecycle state ideas.\n\nAdministrators must define the criteria\
    \ for being in each lifecycle state, and they must define how IdentityNow manages\
    \ users' access to apps and sources for each lifecycle state.\n\nIn IdentityNow,\
    \ administrators can manage lifecycle states by going to Admin > Identities >\
    \ Identity Profile, selecting the identity profile whose lifecycle states they\
    \ want to manage, selecting the 'Provisioning' tab, and using the left panel to\
    \ either select the lifecycle state they want to modify or create a new lifecycle\
    \ state. \n\nIn the 'Provisioning' tab, administrators can make the following\
    \ access changes to an identity profile's lifecycle state: \n\n- Enable/disable\
    \ the lifecycle state for the identity profile.\n\n- Enable/disable source accounts\
    \ for the identity profile's lifecycle state.\n\n- Add existing access profiles\
    \ to grant to the identity profiles in that lifecycle state.\n\n- Create a new\
    \ access profile to grant to the identity profile in that lifecycle state.\n\n\
    Access profiles granted in a previous lifecycle state are automatically revoked\
    \ when the identity moves to a new lifecycle state. \nTo maintain access across\
    \ multiple lifecycle states, administrators must grant the access profiles in\
    \ each lifecycle state. \nFor example, if an administrator wants users with the\
    \ 'HR Employee' identity profile to maintain their building access in both the\
    \ 'Active' and 'Leave of Absence' lifecycle states, the administrator must grant\
    \ the access profile for that building access to both lifecycle states.\n\nDuring\
    \ scheduled refreshes, IdentityNow evaluates lifFecycle states to determine whether\
    \ their assigned identities have the access defined in the lifecycle states' access\
    \ profiles. \nIf the identities are missing access, IdentityNow provisions that\
    \ access. \n\nAdministrators can also use the 'Provisioning' tab to configure\
    \ email notifications for IdentityNow to send whenever an identity with that identity\
    \ profile has a lifecycle state change. \nRefer to [Configuring Lifecycle State\
    \ Notifications](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/provisioning/lifecycle.html#configuring-lifecycle-state-notifications)\
    \ for more information on how to do so.\n\nAn identity's lifecycle state can have\
    \ four different statuses: the lifecycle state's status can be 'Active,' it can\
    \ be 'Not Set,' it can be 'Not Valid,' or it 'Does Not Match Technical Name Case.'\

    \ this functionality in place, administrators can create password dictionaries\
    \ to prevent users from using certain words or characters in their passwords.\
    \ \n\nA password dictionary is a list of words or characters that users are prevented\
    \ from including in their passwords. \nThis can help protect users from themselves\
    \ and force them to create passwords that are not easy to break. \n\nA password\
    \ dictionary must meet the following requirements to for the API to handle them\
    \ correctly: \n\n- It must be in .txt format.\n\n- All characters must be UTF-8\
    \ characters. \n\n- Each line must contain a single word or character with no\
    \ spaces or whitespace characters.\n\n- It must contain at least one line other\
    \ than the locale string.\n\n- Each line must not exceed 128 characters.\n\n-\
    \ The file must not exceed 2500 lines. \n\nAdministrators should also consider\
    \ the following when they create their dictionaries: \n\n- Lines starting with\
    \ a # represent comments.\n\n- All words in the password dictionary are case-insensitive.\
    \ \nFor example, adding the word \"password\" to the dictionary also disallows\
    \ the following: PASSWORD, Password, and PassWord.\n\n- The dictionary uses substring\
    \ matching. \nFor example, adding the word \"spring\" to the dictionary also disallows\
    \ the following: Spring124, 345SprinG, and 8spring.\nUsers can then select 'Change\
    \ Password' to update their passwords. \n\nAdministrators must do the following\
    \ to create a password dictionary: \n\n- Create the text file that will contain\
    \ the prohibited password values.\n\n- If the dictionary is not in English, they\
    \ must add a locale string to the top line: locale:`languageCode`_`countryCode`\n\
    \nThe languageCode value refers to the language's 2-letter ISO 639-1 code.\nThe\
    \ countryCode value refers to the country's 2-letter ISO 3166-1 code.\n\nRefer\

    \ automatically assign the roles to qualified users. This enables users to get\
    \ all the access they need quickly and securely and administrators to spend their\
    \ time on other tasks.\n\nEntitlements represent the most granular level of access\
    \ in IdentityNow. \nAccess profiles represent the next level and often group entitlements.\
    \ \nRoles represent the broadest level of access and often group access profiles.\
    \ \n\nFor example, an Active Directory source in IdentityNow can have multiple\
    \ entitlements: the first, 'Employees,' may represent the access all employees\
    \ have at the organization, and a second, 'Developers,' may represent the access\
    \ all developers have at the organization.\n\nAn administrator can then create\
    \ a broader set of access in the form of an access profile, 'AD Developers' grouping\
    \ the 'Employees' entitlement with the 'Developers' entitlement.\n\nAn administrator\
    \ can then create an even broader set of access in the form of a role grouping\
    \ the 'AD Developers' access profile with another profile, 'GitHub Developers,'\
    \ grouping entitlements for the GitHub source.\n\nWhen users only need Active\
    \ Directory employee access, they can request access to the 'Employees' entitlement.\n\

    \ positions within organizations. \nFor example, an organization's accountant\
    \ can access all the tools the organization's accountants need with the 'Accountant'\
    \ role. \nIf the accountant switches to engineering, a qualified member of the\
    \ organization can quickly revoke the accountant's 'Accountant' access and grant\
    \ access to the 'Engineer' role instead, granting access to all the tools the\
    \ organization's engineers need.\n\nIn IdentityNow, adminstrators can use the\
    \ Access drop-down menu and select Roles to view, configure, and delete existing\
    \ roles, as well as create new ones. \nAdministrators can enable and disable the\

        This API returns a list of Access Profiles.

        A token with API, ORG_ADMIN, ROLE_ADMIN, ROLE_SUBADMIN, SOURCE_ADMIN, or SOURCE_SUBADMIN authority is required to call this API.
      operationId: listAccessProfiles
      parameters:
      - description: |-
          If provided, filters the returned list according to what is visible to the indicated ROLE_SUBADMIN or SOURCE_SUBADMIN Identity. The value of the parameter is either an Identity ID, or the special value **me**, which is shorthand for the calling Identity's ID.

          A 400 Bad Request error is returned if the **for-subadmin** parameter is specified for an Identity that is not a subadmin.
        example: 8c190e6787aa4ed9a90bd9d5344523fb

          Note that for this API the maximum value for limit is 50.
          See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.

          Offset into the full result set. Usually specified with *limit* to paginate through the results.
          See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
        example: 0

      - description: |-
          If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.

          Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.

        By default, if any of the indicated Access Profiles are in use, no deletions will be performed and the **inUse** field of the response indicates the usages that must be removed first. If the request field **bestEffortOnly** is **true**, however, usages are reported in the **inUse** response field but all other indicated Access Profiles will be deleted.

        A token with API, ORG_ADMIN, SOURCE_ADMIN, or SOURCE_SUBADMIN authority is required to call this API. In addition, a SOURCE_SUBADMIN may only use this API to delete Access Profiles which are associated with Sources they are able to administer.

      description: |-
        This gets a list of non-employee requests. There are two contextual uses for the `requested-for` path parameter:
          1. The user has the role context of `idn:nesr:read`, in which case he or
        she may request a list non-employee requests assigned to a particular account manager by passing in that manager's id.
          2. The current user is an account manager, in which case "me" should be
        provided as the `requested-for` value. This will provide the user with a list of the non-employee requests in the source(s) he or she manages.
      operationId: listNonEmployeeRequests
      parameters:

          Max number of results to return.
          See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.

          Offset into the full result set. Usually specified with *limit* to paginate through the results.
          See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
        example: 0
        in: query
        name: offset
        required: false
        schema:

          type: integer
      - description: |-
          If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.

          Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.

          Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.

      description: "This API is used to set a password for an identity. \n\nAn identity\
        \ can change their own password (as well as any of their accounts' passwords)\
        \ if they use a token generated by their IDN user, such as a [personal access\
        \ token](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/authentication#personal-access-tokens)\
        \ or [\"authorization_code\" derived OAuth token](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/authentication#authorization-code-grant-flow).\n\
        \nA token with [API authority](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/authentication#client-credentials-grant-flow)\
        \ can be used to change **any** identity's password or the password of any\
        \ of the identity's accounts. \n\"API authority\" refers to a token that only\
        \ has the \"client_credentials\" grant type.\n\nYou can use this endpoint\
        \ to generate an `encryptedPassword` (RSA encrypted using publicKey). \nTo\
        \ do so, follow these steps:\n\n1. Use [Query Password Info](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/v3/query-password-info)\
        \ to get the following information: `identityId`, `sourceId`, `publicKeyId`,\
        \ `publicKey`, `accounts`, and `policies`. \n\n2. Choose an account from the\
        \ previous response that you will provide as an `accountId` in your request\
        \ to set an encrypted password. \n\n3. Use [Set Identity's Password](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/v3/set-password)\
        \ and provide the information you got from your earlier query. Then add this\
        \ code to your request to get the encrypted password:\n\n```java\nimport javax.crypto.Cipher;\n\
        import java.security.KeyFactory;\nimport java.security.PublicKey;\nimport\
        \ java.security.spec.X509EncodedKeySpec;\nimport java util.Base64;\n\nString\
        \ encrypt(String publicKey, String toEncrypt) throws Exception {\n  byte[]\
        \ publicKeyBytes = Base64.getDecoder().decode(publicKey);\n  byte[] encryptedBytes\
        \ = encryptRsa(publicKeyBytes, toEncrypt.getBytes(\"UTF-8\"));\n  return Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(encryptedBytes);\n\
        }\n\nprivate byte[] encryptRsa(byte[] publicKeyBytes, byte[] toEncryptBytes)\
        \ throws Exception {\n  PublicKey key = KeyFactory.getInstance(\"RSA\").generatePublic(new\
        \ X509EncodedKeySpec(publicKeyBytes));\n  String transformation = \"RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding\"\
        ;\n  Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(transformation);\n  cipher.init(1,\
        \ key);\n  return cipher.doFinal(toEncryptBytes);\n}\n```    \n\nIn this example,\
        \ `toEncrypt` refers to the plain text password you are setting and then encrypting,\
        \ and the `publicKey` refers to the publicKey you got from the first request\
        \ you sent. \n\nYou can then use [Get Password Change Request Status](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/v3/get-password-change-status)\
        \ to check the password change request status. To do so, you must provide\
        \ the `requestId` from your earlier request to set the password. \n"

          Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.

        This API generates a create policy/template based on field value transforms. This API is intended for use when setting up JDBC Provisioning type sources, but it will also work on other source types.
        Transforms can be used in the provisioning policy to create a new attribute that you only need during provisioning.
        Refer to [Transforms in Provisioning Policies](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/docs/transforms/guides/transforms-in-provisioning-policies) for more information.
        A token with ORG_ADMIN authority is required to call this API.

        \ JSONPatch payload. \n\nThe following schema fields are immutable and cannot\
        \ be updated:\n\n- id\n- name\n- created\n- modified\n\n\nTo switch an account\
        \ attribute to a group entitlement, you need to have the following in place:\n\
        \n- `isEntitlement: true`\n- Must define a schema for the group and [add it\
        \ to the source](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/v3/create-source-schema)\

          If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.

          Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.

    offset:
      description: |-
        Offset into the full result set. Usually specified with *limit* to paginate through the results.
        See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
      example: 0
      in: query
      name: offset
      required: false
      schema:
        default: 0
        format: int32
        minimum: 0
        type: integer
    count:
      description: |-
        If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.

        Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.

        See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
      example: true
      in: query

      required: false
      schema:
        default: false
        type: boolean
    limit:

    SourceFeature:
      description: |-
        Optional features that can be supported by an source.
        * AUTHENTICATE: The source supports pass-through authentication.
        * COMPOSITE: The source supports composite source creation.
        * DIRECT_PERMISSIONS: The source supports returning DirectPermissions.
        * DISCOVER_SCHEMA: The source supports discovering schemas for users and groups.
        * ENABLE The source supports reading if an account is enabled or disabled.
        * MANAGER_LOOKUP: The source supports looking up managers as they are encountered in a feed. This is the opposite of NO_RANDOM_ACCESS.
        * NO_RANDOM_ACCESS: The source does not support random access and the getObject() methods should not be called and expected to perform.
        * PROXY: The source can serve as a proxy for another source. When an source has a proxy, all connector calls made with that source are redirected through the connector for the proxy source.
        * SEARCH
        * TEMPLATE
        * UNLOCK: The source supports reading if an account is locked or unlocked.
        * UNSTRUCTURED_TARGETS: The source supports returning unstructured Targets.
        * SHAREPOINT_TARGET: The source supports returning unstructured Target data for SharePoint. It will be typically used by AD, LDAP sources.
        * PROVISIONING: The source can both read and write accounts. Having this feature implies that the provision() method is implemented. It also means that direct and target permissions can also be provisioned if they can be returned by aggregation.
        * GROUP_PROVISIONING: The source can both read and write groups. Having this feature implies that the provision() method is implemented.
        * SYNC_PROVISIONING: The source can provision accounts synchronously.
        * PASSWORD: The source can provision password changes. Since sources can never read passwords, this is should only be used in conjunction with the PROVISIONING feature.
        * CURRENT_PASSWORD: Some source types support verification of the current password
        * ACCOUNT_ONLY_REQUEST: The source supports requesting accounts without entitlements.
        * ADDITIONAL_ACCOUNT_REQUEST: The source supports requesting additional accounts.
        * NO_AGGREGATION: A source that does not support aggregation.
        * GROUPS_HAVE_MEMBERS: The source models group memberships with a member attribute on the group object rather than a groups attribute on the account object. This effects the implementation of delta account aggregation.
        * NO_PERMISSIONS_PROVISIONING: Indicates that the connector cannot provision direct or target permissions for accounts. When DIRECT_PERMISSIONS and PROVISIONING features are present, it is assumed that the connector can also provision direct permissions. This feature disables that assumption and causes permission request to be converted to work items for accounts.
        * NO_GROUP_PERMISSIONS_PROVISIONING: Indicates that the connector cannot provision direct or target permissions for groups. When DIRECT_PERMISSIONS and PROVISIONING features are present, it is assumed that the connector can also provision direct permissions. This feature disables that assumption and causes permission request to be converted to work items for groups.
        * NO_UNSTRUCTURED_TARGETS_PROVISIONING: This string will be replaced by NO_GROUP_PERMISSIONS_PROVISIONING and NO_PERMISSIONS_PROVISIONING.
        * NO_DIRECT_PERMISSIONS_PROVISIONING: This string will be replaced by NO_GROUP_PERMISSIONS_PROVISIONING and NO_PERMISSIONS_PROVISIONING.
