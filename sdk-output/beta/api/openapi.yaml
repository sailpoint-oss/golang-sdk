    \ \nWith this functionality in place, administrators can create access profiles\
    \ and configure them for use throughout IdentityNow, enabling users to get the\
    \ access they need quickly and securely.\n\nAccess profiles group entitlements,\
    \ which represent access rights on sources. \n\nFor example, an Active Directory\
    \ source in IdentityNow can have multiple entitlements: the first, 'Employees,'\
    \ may represent the access all employees have at the organization, and a second,\
    \ 'Developers,' may represent the access all developers have at the organization.\n\
    \nAn administrator can then create a broader set of access in the form of an access\
    \ profile, 'AD Developers' grouping the 'Employees' entitlement with the 'Developers'\
    \ entitlement.\n\nWhen users only need Active Directory employee access, they\
    \ can request access to the 'Employees' entitlement.\n\nWhen users need both Active\
    \ Directory employee and developer access, they can request access to the 'AD\
    \ Developers' access profile.\n\nAccess profiles are the most important units\
    \ of access in IdentityNow. IdentityNow uses access profiles in many features,\
    \ including the following:\n\n- Provisioning: When you use the Provisioning Service,\
    \ lifecycle states and roles both grant access to users in the form of access\
    \ profiles.\n\n- Certifications: You can approve or revoke access profiles in\
    \ certification campaigns, just like entitlements. \n\n- Access Requests: You\
    \ can assign access profiles to applications, and when a user requests access\
    \ to the app associated with an access profile and someone approves the request,\
    \ access is granted to both the application and its associated access profile.\n\
    \n- Roles: You can group one or more access profiles into a role to quickly assign\
    \ access items based on an identity's role. \n\nIn IdentityNow, administrators\
    \ can use the Access drop-down menu and select Access Profiles to view, configure,\
    \ and delete existing access profiles, as well as create new ones. \nAdministrators\
    \ can enable and disable an access profile, and they can also make the following\
    \ configurations: \n\n- Manage Entitlements: Manage the profile's access by adding\
    \ and removing entitlements. \n\n- Access Requests: Configure access profiles\
    \ to be requestable and establish an approval process for any requests that the\
    \ access profile be granted or revoked. \nDo not configure an access profile to\
    \ be requestable without first establishing a secure access request approval process\
    \ for the access profile.\n\n- Multiple Account Options: Define the logic IdentityNow\
    \ uses to provision access to an identity with multiple accounts on the source.\

    With this functionality in place, administrators can view and configure custom\
    \ lifecycle states for use across their organizations, which is key to controlling\
    \ which users have access, when they have access, and the access they have.\n\n\
    A lifecycle state describes a user's status in a company. For example, two lifecycle\
    \ states come by default with IdentityNow: 'Active' and 'Inactive.' \nWhen an\
    \ active employee takes an extended leave of absence from a company, his or her\
    \ lifecycle state may change to 'Inactive,' for security purposes. \nThe inactive\
    \ employee would lose access to all the applications, sources, and sensitive data\
    \ during the leave of absence, but when the employee returns and becomes active\
    \ again, all that access would be restored. \nThis saves administrators the time\
    \ that would otherwise be spent provisioning the employee's access to each individual\
    \ tool, reviewing the employee's certification history, etc. \n\nAdministrators\
    \ must define the criteria for being in each lifecycle state, and they must define\
    \ how IdentityNow manages users' access to apps and sources for each lifecycle\
    \ state.\n\nIn IdentityNow, administrators can manage lifecycle states by going\
    \ to Admin > Identities > Identity Profile, selecting the identity profile whose\
    \ lifecycle states they want to manage, selecting the 'Provisioning' tab, and\
    \ using the left panel to select the lifecycle state they want to modify. \n\n\
    In the 'Provisioning' tab, administrators can make the following access changes\
    \ to an identity profile's lifecycle state: \n\n- Enable/disable the lifecycle\
    \ state for the identity profile.\n\n- Enable/disable source accounts for the\
    \ identity profile's lifecycle state.\n\n- Add existing access profiles to grant\
    \ to the identity profiles in that lifecycle state.\n\n- Create a new access profile\
    \ to grant to the identity profile in that lifecycle state.\n\nAccess profiles\
    \ granted in a previous lifecycle state are automatically revoked when the identity\
    \ moves to a new lifecycle state. \nTo maintain access across multiple lifecycle\
    \ states, administrators must grant the access profiles in each lifecycle state.\
    \ \nFor example, if an administrator wants users with the 'HR Employee' identity\
    \ profile to maintain their building access in both the 'Active' and 'Leave of\
    \ Absence' lifecycle states, the administrator must grant the access profile for\
    \ that building access to both lifecycle states.\n\nDuring scheduled refreshes,\
    \ IdentityNow evaluates lifecycle states to determine whether their assigned identities\
    \ have the access defined in the lifecycle states' access profiles. \nIf the identities\
    \ are missing access, IdentityNow provisions that access. \n\nAdministrators can\
    \ also use the 'Provisioning' tab to configure email notifications for IdentityNow\
    \ to send whenever an identity with that identity profile has a lifecycle state\
    \ change. \nRefer to [Configuring Lifecycle State Notifications](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/provisioning/lifecycle.html#configuring-lifecycle-state-notifications)\

    \ to provide secure access to non-employees and control that access. \n\nThe 'non-employee'\
    \ term refers to any consultant, contractor, intern, or other user in an organization\
    \ who is not a full-time permanent employee. \nOrganizations can track non-employees'\
    \ access and activity in IdentityNow by creating and maintaining non-employee\
    \ sources. \nOrganizations can have a maximum of 50 non-employee sources. \n\n\
    By using SailPoint's Non-Employee Lifecycle Management functionality, you agree\
    \ to the following:\n\n- SailPoint is not responsible for storing sensitive data.\
    \ \nYou may only add account attributes to non-employee identities that are necessary\
    \ for business operations and are consistent with your contractual limitations\
    \ on data that may be sent or stored in IdentityNow.\n\n- You are responsible\
    \ for regularly downloading your list of non-employee accounts for all the sources\
    \ you create and storing this list of accounts in a managed location to maintain\
    \ an authoritative system of record and backup data for these accounts.\n\nTo\
    \ manage non-employees in IdentityNow, administrators must create a non-employee\
    \ source and add accounts to the source. \n\nTo create a non-employee source in\
    \ IdentityNow, administrators must use the Admin panel to go to Connections >\
    \ Sources.\nThey must then specify 'Non-Employee' in the 'Source Type' field.\

    \ to a non-employee source in IdentityNow, administrators can select the non-employee\
    \ source and add the accounts. \nThey can also use the 'Manage Non-Employees'\
    \ widget on their user dashboards to reach the list of sources and then select\
    \ the non-employee source they want to add the accounts to. \n\nAdministrators\
    \ can either add accounts individually or in bulk. Each non-employee source can\
    \ have a maximum of 20,000 accounts. \nTo add accounts in bulk, they must select\
    \ the 'Bulk Upload' option and upload a CSV file. \nRefer to [Adding Accounts](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/common/non-employee-mgmt.html#adding-accounts)\

    Event Triggers provide real-time updates to changes in IdentityNow so you can take action as soon as an event occurs, rather than poll an API endpoint for updates. IdentityNow provides a user interface within the admin console to create and manage trigger subscriptions.  These endpoints allow for programatically creating and managing trigger subscriptions.

    There are two types of event triggers:
      * `FIRE_AND_FORGET`: This trigger type will send a payload to each subscriber without needing a response.  Each trigger of this type has a limit of **50 subscriptions**.
      * `REQUEST_RESPONSE`: This trigger type will send a payload to a subscriber and expect a response back.  Each trigger of this type may only have **one subscription**.

- description: "Use this API to implement work item functionality. \nWith this functionality\
    \ in place, users can manage their work items (tasks). \n\nWork items refer to\
    \ the tasks users see in IdentityNow's Task Manager. \nThey can see the pending\
    \ work items they need to complete, as well as the work items they have already\
    \ completed. \nTask Manager lists the work items along with the involved sources,\
    \ identities, accounts, and the timestamp when the work item was created. \nFor\
    \ example, a user may see a pending 'Create an Account' work item for the identity\
    \ Fred.Astaire in GitHub for Fred's GitHub account, fred-astaire-sp. \nOnce the\
    \ user completes the work item, the work item will be listed with his or her other\
    \ completed work items. \n\nTo complete work items, users can use their dashboards\
    \ and select the 'My Tasks' widget. \nThe widget will list any work items they\
    \ need to complete, and they can select the work item from the list to review\
    \ its details. \nWhen they complete the work item, they can select 'Mark Complete'\
    \ to add it to their list of completed work items. \n\nRefer to [Task Manager](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/user-help/task_manager.html)\
    \ for more information about work items, including the different types of work\
    \ items users may need to complete.\n"

    Workflows allow administrators to create custom automation scripts directly within IdentityNow.  These automation scripts respond to [event triggers](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/docs/event-triggers#how-to-get-started-with-event-triggers) and perform a series of actions to perform tasks that are either too cumbersome or not available in the IdentityNow UI.  Workflows can be configured via a graphical user interface within IdentityNow, or by creating and uploading a JSON formatted script to the Workflow service.  The Workflows API collection provides the necessary functionality to create, manage, and test your workflows via REST.

    Workflows is currently in Beta, and is not generally available to all customer tenants.  If you would like to participate in the beta program, please [submit an application](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/e758ab109dc649589f57b4b5c41d4373).  You must be a customer or partner to participate.

    Refer to [Creating and Managing Workflows] for more information about how to build workflows in the visual builder in the IdentityNow UI.

        This API returns a list of Access Profiles.

        A token with API, ORG_ADMIN, ROLE_ADMIN, ROLE_SUBADMIN, SOURCE_ADMIN, or SOURCE_SUBADMIN authority is required to call this API.
      operationId: listAccessProfiles
      parameters:
      - description: |-
          If provided, filters the returned list according to what is visible to the indicated ROLE_SUBADMIN or SOURCE_SUBADMIN Identity. The value of the parameter is either an Identity ID, or the special value **me**, which is shorthand for the calling Identity's ID.

          A 400 Bad Request error is returned if the **for-subadmin** parameter is specified for an Identity that is not a subadmin.
        example: 8c190e6787aa4ed9a90bd9d5344523fb
        in: query
        name: for-subadmin

        schema:
          type: string
      - description: |-
          Note that for this API the maximum value for limit is 50.
          See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
        example: 50
        in: query
        name: limit
        required: false
        schema:
          default: 50
          format: int32
          maximum: 50
          minimum: 0
          type: integer
      - description: |-
          Offset into the full result set. Usually specified with *limit* to paginate through the results.
          See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
        example: 0
        in: query
        name: offset
        required: false
        schema:
          default: 0
          format: int32
          minimum: 0
          type: integer
      - description: |-
          If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.

          Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.

          See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
        example: true

        \ duplicate access requests in quick succession, or you submit an access request\
        \ for access that is already in progress, approved, or rejected.\nIt is best\
        \ practice to check for any existing access requests that reference the same\
        \ access items before submitting a new access request.  This can\nbe accomplished\
        \ by using the [access request status](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/v3/list-access-request-status)\
        \ or the [pending access request approvals](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/v3/list-pending-approvals)\
        \ endpoints.  You can also\nuse the [search API](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/v3/search)\
        \ to check the existing access items that an identity has before submitting\n\
        an access request to ensure you are not requesting access that is already\
        \ granted.\n\nThere are two types of access request:\n\n__GRANT_ACCESS__\n\
        * Can be requested for multiple identities in a single request.\n* Supports\
        \ self request and request on behalf of other users, see '/beta/access-request-config'\
        \ endpoint for request configuration options.  \n* Allows any authenticated\
        \ token (except API) to call this endpoint to request to grant access to themselves.\
        \ Depending on the configuration, a user can request access for others.\n\
        * Roles, Access Profiles and Entitlements can be requested.\n* While requesting\
        \ entitlements, maximum of 25 entitlements and 10 recipients are allowed in\
        \ a request.\n \n__REVOKE_ACCESS__\n* Can only be requested for a single identity\
        \ at a time.\n* Does not support self request. Only manager can request to\
        \ revoke access for their directly managed employees.\n* If removeDate is\
        \ specified, then the access will be removed on that date and time.\n* Allows\
        \ a manager to request to revoke access for direct employees. A token with\
        \ ORG_ADMIN authority can also request to revoke access from anyone.\n* Roles\
        \ and Access Profiles can be requested for revocation. Revoke request for\
        \ entitlements are not supported currently.\n\nNOTE: There is no indication\
        \ to the approver in the IdentityNow UI that the approval request is for a\
        \ revoke action. Take this into consideration when calling this API.\n\nA\

        This endpoint closes access requests that are stuck in a pending state. It can be used throughout a request's lifecycle (even after the approval state, unlike <a href="https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/v3/cancel-access-request">Cancel Access Request</a>). A token with ORG_ADMIN authority is required.

        To find pending access requests via the UI, navigate to Search and use this query: status: Pending AND "Access Request". Use the Column Chooser to select "Tracking Number," and the Download button to export a CSV containing the Tracking Numbers.

        To find pending access requests via the API, use <a href="https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/v3/list-account-activities">List Account Activities</a>.

        Input the ids from either source

        To track the status of endpoint requests, navigate to Search and use this query: name:"Close Identity Requests". Search will include "Close Identity Requests Started" audits when requests are initiated, and "Close Identity Requests Completed" audits when requests are completed. The completion audit will list the Identity Request IDs that finished in error.

        This API triggers the <a href="https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/docs/event-triggers/triggers/provisioning-action-completed">Provisioning Action Completed</a> event trigger for each access request that is closed.

          If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.

          Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.

          If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.

          Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.

        This API returns the status of an *in-progress* account aggregation, along with the total number of **NEW**, **CHANGED** and **DELETED** accounts found since the previous aggregation, and the number of those accounts that have been processed so far.

        Accounts that have not changed since the previous aggregation are not included in **totalAccounts** and **processedAccounts** counts returned by this API. This is distinct from **Accounts Scanned** shown in the Aggregation UI, which indicates total accounts scanned regardless of whether they changed or not.

        Since this endpoint reports on the status of an *in-progress* account aggregation, totalAccounts and processedAccounts may change between calls to this endpoint.

        *Only available up to an hour after the aggregation completes. May respond with *404 Not Found* after that.*

        A token with ORG_ADMIN, SOURCE_ADMIN, SOURCE_SUBADMIN or DASHBOARD authority is required to call this API.

      description: |-
        Generates a new campaign from a campaign template.
        The campaign object contained in the template has special formatting applied to its name and description fields in order to determine the generated campaign's name/description. Placeholders in those fields are formatted with the current date and time upon generation.
        Placeholders consist of a percent sign followed by a letter indicating what should be inserted; for example, "%Y" will insert the current year; a campaign template named "Campaign for %y" would generate a campaign called "Campaign for 2020" (assuming the year at generation time is 2020).
        Valid placeholders are the date/time conversion suffix characters supported by [java.util.Formatter](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Formatter.html).
        Requires roles ORG_ADMIN.

          Supported fields and primitive operators:

          **target**: *eq, sw*

          **rights**: *ca*

          Supported composite operators:

          All field values (second filter operands) are case-insensitive for this API.

          Only a single *and* or *or* composite filter operator may be used. It must also be used between a target filter and a rights filter, not between 2 filters for the same field.
          For example,

          The following is valid:
          *?filters=rights+ca+(%22CREATE%22)+and+target+eq+%22SYS.OBJAUTH2%22*

          The following is invalid:

        This API returns a list of entitlements.

        This API can be used in one of the two following ways: either getting entitlements for a specific **account-id**, or getting via use of **filters** (those two options are exclusive).

        Any authenticated token can call this API.

          If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.

          Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.

          If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.

          Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.

          If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.

          Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.

        This API updates an existing Role using [JSON Patch](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902) syntax.

        The following fields are patchable: **name**, **description**, **enabled**, **owner**, **accessProfiles**, **membership**, **requestable**, **accessRequestConfig**, **revokeRequestConfig**, **segments**
        A token with API, ORG_ADMIN, ROLE_ADMIN, or ROLE_SUBADMIN authority is required to call this API. In addition, a token with ROLE_SUBADMIN authority may only call this API if all Access Profiles included in the Role are associated to Sources with management workgroups of which the ROLE_SUBADMIN is a member.
        The maximum supported length for the description field is 2000 characters. Longer descriptions will be preserved for existing roles, however, any new roles as well as any updates to existing descriptions will be limited to 2000 characters.

          If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.

          Filter results using the standard syntax described in [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#filtering-results)

          Filtering is supported for the following fields and operators:

          **id**: *eq, in*

          **name**: *eq*

          **type**: *eq, in*

          **cluster**: *eq, in*

          type: string
        style: form
      - description: |-
          If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.

          Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.

        This post will import objects from a JSON configuration file into a tenant. By default, every import will first export all existing objects supported by sp-config as a backup before the import is attempted. The backup is provided so that the state of the configuration prior to the import is available for inspection or restore if needed. The backup can be skipped by setting "excludeBackup" to true in the import options. If a backup is performed, the id of the backup will be provided in the ImportResult as the "exportJobId". This can be downloaded  using the /sp-config/export/{exportJobId}/download endpoint.
        Request will need the following security scope:
        - sp:config:manage
      operationId: spConfigImport

          \ will pre-process the import file and attempt to resolve references within\

          If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.

          Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.

          If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.

          Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.

    SourceFeature:
      description: |-
        Optional features that can be supported by an source.
        * AUTHENTICATE: The source supports pass-through authentication.
        * COMPOSITE: The source supports composite source creation.
        * DIRECT_PERMISSIONS: The source supports returning DirectPermissions.
        * DISCOVER_SCHEMA: The source supports discovering schemas for users and groups.
        * ENABLE The source supports reading if an account is enabled or disabled.
        * MANAGER_LOOKUP: The source supports looking up managers as they are encountered in a feed. This is the opposite of NO_RANDOM_ACCESS.
        * NO_RANDOM_ACCESS: The source does not support random access and the getObject() methods should not be called and expected to perform.
        * PROXY: The source can serve as a proxy for another source. When an source has a proxy, all connector calls made with that source are redirected through the connector for the proxy source.
        * SEARCH
        * TEMPLATE
        * UNLOCK: The source supports reading if an account is locked or unlocked.
        * UNSTRUCTURED_TARGETS: The source supports returning unstructured Targets.
        * SHAREPOINT_TARGET: The source supports returning unstructured Target data for SharePoint. It will be typically used by AD, LDAP sources.
        * PROVISIONING: The source can both read and write accounts. Having this feature implies that the provision() method is implemented. It also means that direct and target permissions can also be provisioned if they can be returned by aggregation.
        * GROUP_PROVISIONING: The source can both read and write groups. Having this feature implies that the provision() method is implemented.
        * SYNC_PROVISIONING: The source can provision accounts synchronously.
        * PASSWORD: The source can provision password changes. Since sources can never read passwords, this is should only be used in conjunction with the PROVISIONING feature.
        * CURRENT_PASSWORD: Some source types support verification of the current password
        * ACCOUNT_ONLY_REQUEST: The source supports requesting accounts without entitlements.
        * ADDITIONAL_ACCOUNT_REQUEST: The source supports requesting additional accounts.
        * NO_AGGREGATION: A source that does not support aggregation.
        * GROUPS_HAVE_MEMBERS: The source models group memberships with a member attribute on the group object rather than a groups attribute on the account object. This effects the implementation of delta account aggregation.
        * NO_PERMISSIONS_PROVISIONING: Indicates that the connector cannot provision direct or target permissions for accounts. When DIRECT_PERMISSIONS and PROVISIONING features are present, it is assumed that the connector can also provision direct permissions. This feature disables that assumption and causes permission request to be converted to work items for accounts.
        * NO_GROUP_PERMISSIONS_PROVISIONING: Indicates that the connector cannot provision direct or target permissions for groups. When DIRECT_PERMISSIONS and PROVISIONING features are present, it is assumed that the connector can also provision direct permissions.
