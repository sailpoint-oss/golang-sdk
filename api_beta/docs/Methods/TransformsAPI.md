## create-transform


Creates a new transform object immediately. By default, the internal flag is set to false to indicate that this is a custom transform. Only SailPoint employees have the ability to create a transform with internal set to true. Newly created Transforms can be used in the Identity Profile mappings within the UI. A token with transform write authority is required to call this API.

------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
 Body  | transform | [**Transform**](../models/transform) | True  | The transform to be created.

	
### Return type

[**TransformRead**](../models/transform-read)

### Responses

## list-transforms


Gets a list of all saved transform objects.
A token with transforms-list read authority is required to call this API.

### Parameters 
Param Type | Name | Data Type | Required  | Description
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
  Query | offset | **int32** |   (optional) (default to 0) | Offset into the full result set. Usually specified with *limit* to paginate through the results. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | limit | **int32** |   (optional) (default to 250) | Max number of results to return. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | count | **bool** |   (optional) (default to false) | If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.  Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.  See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | name | **string** |   (optional) | Name of the transform to retrieve from the list.
  Query | filters | **string** |   (optional) | Filter results using the standard syntax described in [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#filtering-results)  Filtering is supported for the following fields and operators:  **internal**: *eq*  **name**: *eq, sw*
