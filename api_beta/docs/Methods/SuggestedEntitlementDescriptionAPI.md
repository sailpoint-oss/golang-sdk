## list-seds


List of Suggested Entitlement Description

### Parameters 
Param Type | Name | Data Type | Required  | Description
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
  Query | limit | **int64** |   (optional) | Integer specifying the maximum number of records to return in a single API call.  The standard syntax described in [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#paginating-results). If it is not specified, a default limit is used.
  Query | filters | **string** |   (optional) | Filter results using the standard syntax described in [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#filtering-results)  Filtering is supported for the following fields and operators:  **batchId**: *eq*  **status**: *eq, ne, in*  **displayName**: *eq, co*
  Query | count | **bool** |   (optional) | If `true` it will populate the `X-Total-Count` response header with the number of results that would be returned if `limit` and `offset` were ignored.  The standard syntax described in [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#paginating-results). Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send `count=true` if that value will not be used.
  Query | countOnly | **bool** |   (optional) | If `true` it will populate the `X-Total-Count` response header with the number of results that would be returned if `limit` and `offset` were ignored. This parameter differs from the Coun parameter in that this one skip executing the actual query and always return an empty array.
  Query | requestedByAnyone | **bool** |   (optional) | By default, the ListSeds API will only return items that you have requested to be generated.   This option will allow you to see all items that have been requested
  Query | showPendingStatusOnly | **bool** |   (optional) | Will limit records to items that are in \"suggested\" or \"approved\" status
