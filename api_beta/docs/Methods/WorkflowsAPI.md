## list-workflow-executions


This lists the executions for a given workflow. Workflow executions are available for up to 90 days before being archived. By default, you can get a maximum of 250 executions.  To get executions past the first 250 records, you can do the following: 
1. Use the [Get Workflows](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/beta/list-workflows) endpoint to get your workflows. 
2. Get your workflow ID from the response. 
3. You can then do either of the following: 

  - Filter to find relevant workflow executions.
  For example, you can filter for failed workflow executions: `GET /workflows/:workflowID/executions?filters=status eq "Failed"`

  - You can paginate through results with the `offset` parameter. 
  For example, you can page through 50 executions per page and use that as a way to get to the records past the first 250. 
  Refer to [Paginating Results](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#paginating-results) for more information about the query parameters you can use to achieve pagination. 

### Parameters 
Param Type | Name | Data Type | Required  | Description
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
Path   | id | **string** | True  | Id of the workflow
  Query | limit | **int32** |   (optional) (default to 250) | Max number of results to return. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | offset | **int32** |   (optional) (default to 0) | Offset into the full result set. Usually specified with *limit* to paginate through the results. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | count | **bool** |   (optional) (default to false) | If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.  Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.  See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | filters | **string** |   (optional) | Filter results using the standard syntax described in [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#filtering-results)  Filtering is supported for the following fields and operators:  **startTime**: *eq, lt, le, gt, ge*  **status**: *eq*
