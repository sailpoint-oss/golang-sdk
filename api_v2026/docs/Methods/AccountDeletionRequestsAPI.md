All URIs are relative to *https://sailpoint.api.identitynow.com/v2026*

Method | HTTP request | Description

[**get-account-deletion-requests**](#get-account-deletion-requests) | **Get** `/account-requests/deletion` | List of Account Deletion Requests


## get-account-deletion-requests
:::warning experimental 
This API is currently in an experimental state. The API is subject to change based on feedback and further testing. You must include the X-SailPoint-Experimental header and set it to `true` to use this endpoint.
:::
:::tip setting x-sailpoint-experimental header
 on the configuration object you can set the `x-sailpoint-experimental` header to `true' to enable all experimantl endpoints within the SDK.
 Example:
 ```go
   configuration = Configuration()
   configuration.Experimental = true
 ```
:::
List of Account Deletion Requests
Retrieves a paginated list of account deletion requests filtered by the provided query parameters. When the "mine" parameter is set to true, the response includes only those deletion requests that were initiated by the currently authenticated user. If "mine" is false or not specified, the endpoint returns all account deletion requests associated with the current tenant, regardless of the initiator. This allows both users and administrators to view relevant deletion requests based on their access level and intent.

### Path Parameters



### Other Parameters

Other parameters are passed through a pointer to a apiGetAccountDeletionRequestsRequest struct via the builder pattern


Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **xSailPointExperimental** | **string** | Use this header to enable this experimental API. | [default to &quot;true&quot;]
 **limit** | **int32** | Max number of results to return. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information. | [default to 250]
 **offset** | **int32** | Offset into the full result set. Usually specified with *limit* to paginate through the results. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information. | [default to 0]
 **count** | **bool** | If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.  Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count&#x3D;true** if that value will not be used.  See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information. | [default to false]
 **mine** | **bool** | Determines whether to return only the account deletion requests initiated by the currently authenticated user. If set to true, the response includes only deletion requests created by the logged-in user. If set to false or not provided, the response includes all deletion requests for the tenant, regardless of the initiator. This parameter allows users to view their own requests, while administrators can view all requests within the tenant. | [default to false]
