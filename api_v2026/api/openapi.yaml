        This API returns a list of entitlements.

        This API can be used in one of the two following ways: either getting entitlements for a specific **account-id**, or getting via use of **filters** (those two options are exclusive).

        Any authenticated token can call this API.
      operationId: listEntitlements
      parameters:
      - description: |-
          If present and not empty, additionally filters Entitlements to those which are assigned to the Segment(s) which are visible to the Identity with the specified ID.
          Cannot be specified with the **account-id** or **for-segment-ids** param(s). It is also illegal to specify a value that refers to a different user's Identity.
        example: e554098913544630b5985e9042f5e44b
        in: query
        name: segmented-for-identity
        required: false
        schema:
          type: string
      - description: |-
          If present and not empty, additionally filters Access Profiles to those which are assigned to the Segment(s) with the specified IDs.
          Cannot be specified with the **account-id** or **segmented-for-identity** param(s).
        example: "041727d4-7d95-4779-b891-93cf41e98249,a378c9fa-bae5-494c-804e-a1e30f69f649"

          See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
        example: 250

      - description: |-
          If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.

          Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.

          See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.

        This API applies an update to every entitlement of the list.


        The number of entitlements to update is limited to 50 items maximum.


        The JsonPatch update follows the [JSON Patch](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902) standard.
        examples of allowed operations :
        `**{ "op": "replace", "path": "/requestable","value": boolean }**`
        `**{ "op": "replace", "path": "/privilegeOverride/level","value": string }**`

        A token with ORG_ADMIN or API authority is required to call this API.

          See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
        example: 0

          If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.

          Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.
