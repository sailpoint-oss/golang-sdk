## create-account


This API submits an account creation task and returns the task ID.  
You must include the `sourceId` where the account will be created in the `attributes` object.
This endpoint creates an account on the source record in your ISC tenant. This is useful for Flat File (`DelimitedFile`) type sources because it allows you to aggregate new accounts without needing to import a new CSV file every time. 
However, if you use this endpoint to create an account for a Direct Connection type source, you must ensure that the account also exists on the target source.  The endpoint doesn't actually provision the account on the target source, which means that if the account doesn't also exist on the target source, an aggregation between the source and your tenant will remove it from your tenant. 
A token with ORG_ADMIN authority is required to call this API.

### Parameters 
Param Type | Name | Data Type | Required  | Description
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
 Body  | accountAttributesCreate | [**AccountAttributesCreate**](../models/account-attributes-create) | True  | 

	
### Return type

[**AccountsAsyncResult**](../models/accounts-async-result)

### Responses
Code | Description  | Data Type
------------- | ------------- | -------------
202 | Async task details | AccountsAsyncResult
400 | Client Error - Returned if the request body is invalid. | ErrorResponseDto
401 | Unauthorized - Returned if there is no authorization header, or if the JWT token is expired. | ListAccessProfiles401Response
403 | Forbidden - Returned if the user you are running as, doesn&#39;t have access to this end-point. | ErrorResponseDto
429 | Too Many Requests - Returned in response to too many requests in a given period of time - rate limited. The Retry-After header in the response includes how long to wait before trying again. | ListAccessProfiles429Response
500 | Internal Server Error - Returned if there is an unexpected error. | ErrorResponseDto

## delete-account


Use this API to delete an account. 
This endpoint submits an account delete task and returns the task ID. 
This endpoint only deletes the account from IdentityNow, not the source itself, which can result in the account's returning with the next aggregation between the source and IdentityNow.  To avoid this scenario, it is recommended that you [disable accounts](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/v3/disable-account) rather than delete them. This will also allow you to reenable the accounts in the future. 
A token with ORG_ADMIN authority is required to call this API.
>**NOTE: You can only delete accounts from sources of the "DelimitedFile" type.**

### Parameters 
Param Type | Name | Data Type | Required  | Description
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
