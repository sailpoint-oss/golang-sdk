All URIs are relative to *https://sailpoint.api.identitynow.com/v3*

Method | HTTP request | Description
------------- | ------------- | -------------
[**SearchAggregate**](#search-aggregate) | **Post** /search/aggregate | Perform a Search Query Aggregation
[**SearchCount**](#search-count) | **Post** /search/count | Count Documents Satisfying a Query

## search-aggregate


Performs a search query aggregation and returns the aggregation result. By default, you can page a maximum of 10,000 search result records.  To page past 10,000 records, you can use searchAfter paging.  Refer to [Paginating Search Queries](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#paginating-search-queries) for more information about how to implement searchAfter paging. 

### Parameters 
Param Type | Name | Data Type | Required  | Description
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
 Body  | search | [**Search**](../models/search) | True  | 
  Query | offset | **int32** |   (optional) (default to 0) | Offset into the full result set. Usually specified with *limit* to paginate through the results. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | limit | **int32** |   (optional) (default to 250) | Max number of results to return. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | count | **bool** |   (optional) (default to false) | If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.  Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.  See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
